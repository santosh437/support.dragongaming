Automate your WordPress Editorial Workflow with Oasis Workflow.

== Description ==

Any online publishing organization has one or several Managing Editors responsible for keeping the arrangement of editorial content flowing in an organized fashion.

Oasis Workflow plugin is designed to automate any workflow process using a simple, intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).

The plugin provides three processes:

1. Assignment - represents task related to content generation.

2. Review - represents task related to content review.

3. Publish - represents the actual "publish" task.

**Visual Work flow Designer**
 - Configure your work flow using the easy drag and drop designer interface. See screen shots for more detail.

**Role-Based routing definitions allow you to assign tasks dynamically**
 - By using role-based routing, you can ensure that your process moves forward as quickly as possible without sacrificing accountability.

**Inbox**
 - Users can view their current assignments and sign off their tasks once it's completed.

**Process history lets users retrace their steps**
 - For auditing purposes a record is maintained of all posts that are routed through a workflow process. The process history also captures the comments added by the user when they signed off the particular task.

**Reassign - How to pass the buck?**
 - What if you have been assigned a workflow task, but you feel you are not the appropriate person to complete it? No worry, you can assign the task to another person. 

**Due Date and Email reminders** help you to publish your articles on time.

**Out of the box workflow**
To get you started, the plugin comes with an out of the box workflow. You can also modify the workflow to suit your needs. 

You can find the complete list of features on the [support](http://oasisworkflow.com) site.

**Supported languages**
 - English
 - Spanish
 - French
 
**Translators**
* French (fr_FR) - [Baptiste Rieg](http://www.batrieg.com)

**If you need help setting up the roles, we recommend the [User Role Editor plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/user-role-editor/ "User Role Editor plugin").**
